# Find files and open them in vim

## Inspiration derived from autojump and control-p

* This tool is intended to search in your current working directory path and find a file based on a partial name given via regular expression and then open the file in vim. If multiple files are found then it prompts the user with a list of files to choose from.
* Score idea from [CrossPlatform.net](http://crossplatform.net/sublime-text-ctrl-p-fuzzy-matching-in-python/)
